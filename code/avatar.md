## scene 1

no donald
white screen
slow music
no overhead light


## scene 2

donald is behind screen
he uses his hand to swirl around
lots of tiny avatars appear on the bottom
he chooses one and pulls it up to make it bigger
the other avatars fade away

control the mixamo rope climb with slider on novation controller
sync it manually with donald picking a donald

donald casts his hand shadow on one side of the screen
the avatar does the same
then with the leg, then with the head, in alternating sides

then donald slides into scene and the avatar does too, donald changes perspective by moving up and down stage, to make his shadow bigger and smaller,
the avatar does the opposite.
